# Measuring the performance of PCA and the distortion it introduces in single-cell data analysis

This repository accompanies the manuscript "Principal Component Analysis introduces distortion and artifacts in single-cell genomics"(_in preparation_), by Davi Sidarta-Oliveira and Licio Velloso.

It contains code for evaluating whether PCA sucessfully carries most of the variance of a given dataset to its first few eigenvectors Principal Components, and to assess whether poor performance leads to distorted downstream results, such as when learning nearest-neighbors graphs, clustering and non-linear dimensional reductions.

For learning more, check the tutorial notebook.
